data2vid is a proof-of-concept (PoC) Go module that provides a command-line interface (CLI) for encoding arbitrary data files (such as PDF, JPEG, ZIP, TXT, etc.) into MP4 video files and subsequently decoding them back to their original form.  

The tool works by converting raw binary data directly into mp4 video black & white frames.  



Ffmpeg standard CLI should be installed on the user OS => https://ffmpeg.org/
